# ADR Templates

This directory contains template ADRs. The minimal template only has required
sections of an ADR while the complete template has all of the possible
sections.

You are highly encouraged to provide as much information and context to an ADR
as possible and reasonable, so the default should be to use
[`adr-template.md`](./adr-template.md)
